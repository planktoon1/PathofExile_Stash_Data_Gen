# PathofExile_Stash_Data_Gen

Repo containing the functions and utilities i use to generate the datafiles that "Path of Exile - Stash" project uses

## Dumping RePoE Data

For now the idea is that on every game update we can dump all the new RePoE data into the "./input/RePoE_Data" folder and then simply run the "npm run gen" script to generate all output files into "./output" and then simply copy them over into the main project.
